This project is basically a clone of the Netflix web app.

It contains the following features:
  - A Nav bar with the Logo, Sign In / Sign Up ||  Account / Log Out Buttons
  - A main section that shows a movie in a well-designed background + overlay text
  - A set of 4 rows of horizontally scrollable thumbnails with buttons that allow the scrolling
  - Sign Up / Sign In pages
  - Authentication & Protected routing where account related pages can only be accessed once signed in, improving on security of the application.
  - Ability to save movies to a Firebase cloud storage service, hence one can see a list of their favourite movies under the Account Page

    Additional features being added are:
    - The ability to watch the trailer of any movie via a video modal. This would add a dynamic aspect to the web app, making it less static.


Have a look at the code and let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback !
